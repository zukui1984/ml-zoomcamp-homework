# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn for telecom companies using machine learning to enable proactive retention strategies.

## Problem Description

Customer churn (when customers stop using a service) costs the telecom industry billions annually. This project builds a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing companies to:

- Identify at-risk customers before they leave
- Offer targeted retention incentives
- Reduce customer acquisition costs
- Improve customer lifetime value

**Business Impact**: Reducing churn by 5% can increase profits by 25-95% (Harvard Business Review)
